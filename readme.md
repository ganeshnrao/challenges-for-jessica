Dear Jessica,

This repository is for you! I hope you will enjoy tackling these challenges and learn to write some functions in Javascript. Try to tackle one problem everyday. To get started, clone this repository and follow these steps.

1. Branch off the `master` branch for each challenge and name your branch as `day-<number>`, e.g. `day-01` for the first day&rsquo;s challenge.
2. Work on the files in the corresponding folder, e.g. `day-01/index.js` for the first day&rsquo;s challenge.
3. All of the challenges will be using Node, so you can run them easily from the terminal using the command `node <fileToRun>` e.g. `node day-01/index.js` to run the first day&rsquo;s challenge.
4. Once you&rsquo;ve solved the challenge (or most of it), create a pull-request targeted to the `solutions` branch.

In each challenge folder you will see a `readme.md` file which will explain the challenge and its requirements and provide some context. In the javascript files, you will see comments above the function specifying the function&rsquo;s inputs and return values, this is the function signature, and you may not change these. Your task is to write code inside the functions so that it returns the value as defined by the specification. Good luck!
