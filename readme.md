Dear Jessica,

This repository is for you! I hope you will enjoy tackling these challenges and learn to write some functions in Javascript. Try to tackle one problem everyday. To get started, clone this repository and follow these steps.

1. Create a separate branch for each challenge and name your branch as `day-<number>`, e.g. `day-01` for the first day&rsquo;s challenge.
2. Work on the file with the name of the day, e.g. `day-01.js` on the branch for that first day.
3. All of the challenges here will be using Node. So you can run them easily in the terminal using the command `node` e.g. `node day-01.js` to run the first day&rsquo;s challenge.
4. Once you&rsquo;ve solved the challenge (or most of it), create a pull-request targeted to the `master` branch.

In the challenge files, above each function, you will see a comment specifying the function&rsquo;s inputs and return values. This is the function signature, and you may not change these. Your task is to fill in the functions with code so that it returns the value as defined in the specification. Good luck!
