## Generate random full names

You are given an array of 200 most common first names and another array of 1000 most common last names. Your task is to implement a function called `generateFullName` which takes those two arrays as inputs and generates a random full name.

Note that there are some names that might appear in both the first names and last names arrays, so take care to avoid names where the first and last names are the same, e.g. `"James James"`, `"Michael Michael"` should be avoided.
